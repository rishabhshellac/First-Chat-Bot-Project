# Chat Bot
3 Properties to Build A Skill to Deploy A Chatbot

# Intents
	An intent categorizes an end-user's intention for one conversation turn.
	For each agent, you define many intents, where your combined intents can 
	handle a complete conversation. When an end-user writes or says something,
	referred to as an end-user expression, Dialogflow matches the end-user 
	expression to the best intent in your agent. 
	Matching an intent is also known as intent classification.
	
# Entities
	An entity modifies an intent. For example, if a user types “show me 
	yesterday’s financial news”, the entities are “yesterday” and “financial”.
	Entities are given a name, such as “dateTime” and “newsType”. 
	Entities are sometimes referred to as slots.
	
# Dialog Skill
	A dialog is a branching conversation flow that defines responses 
	to the defined intents and entities. You use the dialog builder 
	in the tool to create conversations with users to provide responses.
